        <h1><u>vs code</u></h1>
       <p> VS Code is an open-source code editor developed by Microsoft, primarily for web development. 
        It provides tools for building applications with a graphical user interface (GUI).
         Though it's a code editor, with extensions, it functions like an Integrated Development Environment.(IDE).</p>
 <h1><u>key features</u></h1>
 <body>
    <h3>1.extensibility</h3>
    <p> Studio Code supports a wide range of extensions that allow users to add languages, themes, debuggers, and other functionalities. The marketplace offers thousands of extensions, making it adaptable to many different development environments and workflows.</p>

<h3>2.command pollete</h3>
<p>VS Code is equally accessible from the keyboard. The most important key combination to know is Ctrl+Shift+P, which brings up the Command Palette. From here, you would have access to all of the functionality of VS Code, including keyboard shortcuts for the most common operations.

</p>
 <h3>3.git intigration</h3>
  Visual Studio Code comes with Git integration that allows you to commit, pull, and push your code changes to a remote Git repository.

  <h3>4.change language mood</h3>
  If you want to persist the new language mode for that file type, you can use the Configure File Association for command to associate the current file extension with an installed language.

  Keyboard Shortcut: Ctrl+K M
  <h3>5.zen mode</h3>
  Zen Mode lets you focus on your code by hiding all UI except the editor (no Activity Bar, Status Bar, Side Bar and Panel), going to full screen and centering the editor layout. Zen mode can be toggled using the View menu, Command Palette, or by the shortcut Ctrl+K Z. Double Esc exits Zen Mode.
<h1>extention vs code</h1>
Software development or web development is a field where every developer is searching for some tools, technology, or Visual Studio Code Extensions that can be helpful in boosting their productivity. Different programmers have different choices and they use different approaches. For developers sometimes it becomes quite frustrating to write the same code at multiple places, refreshing the page or doing formatting in code so many times
<table border="1">
    <tr><th>name</th><th>uses</th></tr>
   <tr><td>Live server</td><td>Generally, when we make any change in our code, to see those changes on the browser we need to manually refresh the page to see the changes happening. Here the live server extension comes into the picture. After it has been installed, an automated localhost will be able to run in your browser, which you can start with a single button. Once you makechanges in your code or write something new, after saving it, the browser will auto-refresh itself, then you will be able to see the changes quickly and automatically. The live server enables you to open an HTML document, and it runs a server for you and opens a browser window with the file in it.</td>
   </tr>
   
   <tr><td>live preview</td><td>An extension that hosts a local server for you to preview your web projects on! This extension is most useful for projects where a server is not already created (e.g. not for apps using React, Angular, etc.). To work with these, feel free to run the Simple Browser: Show command that is already built-in with VS Code.</td></tr>

The symbol usage in Emmet allows you to quickly insert repetitive HTML and CSS code using abbreviations and snippets. For example, typing ul>li*3 will create an unordered list with three list items. You can use various symbols, such as >, +, and *, to insert elements and attributes, making coding faster and more efficient</td></tr>
   <tr><td>4</td><td>*</td><td>Emmet is a popular plugin for Visual Studio Code (VS Code) that provides a set of tools for rapidly writing and formatting HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code. The * symbol in Emmet is used to repeat the preceding element. For example would expand to You can also use the * symbol to repeat a group of elements, such as ul>*li>*a. This allows you to write concise and efficient code that is also easy to read and understand.</td></tr>
   <tr><td>5</td><td>+</td><td>	Visual Studio Code (VS Code) users can leverage the Emmet feature to efficiently write HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code. The + symbol in Emmet is used to repeat the preceding element. For example, `ul>li+li+li` expands to This saves time and reduces the need for manual repetition. To use the + symbol, simply type the preceding element, followed by a +, and then the desired number of repetitions. Emmet also supports other symbols like *, ^, and ~, which can be used to create nested elements, add attributes, and more.</td></tr>
